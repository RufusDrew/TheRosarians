      This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which The Rosarians ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, maintains, and
      discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") of "The Rosarians" blog prayer web app ("App"). This
      Privacy Policy applies to the App and all products and services offered by us.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>
      We may collect personal information from Users in various ways, including when Users register on the App, submit
      prayers, update prayers, and in connection with other activities, features, or resources we make available on our
      App. Users may be asked to provide their email address, username, name, and password for registration purposes. We
      collect this information only if voluntarily submitted by the Users. Users can always refuse to supply personal
      information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain App-related activities.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Collected Information</h2>

    <p>
      We may collect and use Users' personal information for the following purposes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>To personalize User experience: We may use information in the aggregate to understand how our Users as a group
        use the services and resources provided on our App.</li>
      <li>To improve our App: We continually strive to improve our App based on the feedback and information we receive
        from Users.</li>
      <li>To send periodic emails: We may use the email address to send User information and updates pertaining to their
        prayers or other requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

    <p>
      We do not sell, trade, or rent Users' personal identification information to others. We may share generic aggregated
      demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding Users with our business
      partners, trusted affiliates, and advertisers for the purposes outlined above.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>

    <p>
      We adopt appropriate data collection, storage, and processing practices, as well as security measures, to protect
      against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of Users' personal information and data stored
      on our App. However, please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a
      result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any
      information you transmit to us or store on the App.
