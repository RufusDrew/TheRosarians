The Catholic Christian Prayers web app is a dynamic platform built using Vue.js, SCSS, and Firebase. The app offers users the ability to store and access a variety of Catholic Christian prayers, with content that is displayed dynamically based on user input. The app offers CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing users to add, edit, and delete prayers as desired.

One of the key features of the app is its audio player, which enables users to listen to prayers as they read them. The app also includes a login and register system, with Firebase providing secure authentication and user management. When users log in, they are able to store their own content, including prayers they have added and edited, in a secure database.

The app is hosted on Firebase, ensuring fast and reliable access for users. Development was carried out using VS Code, with an emphasis on creating a streamlined, user-friendly interface. Overall, the Catholic Christian Prayers web app offers a powerful, intuitive platform for storing and accessing a wide range of Catholic Christian prayers, with a focus on ease of use and user convenience.
